gitpathlib
==========

An read-only implementation of Python's `pathlib`_ that works on Git trees.

.. _pathlib: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html

Installation
------------

This library requires `pygit2`_, which can be hard to install.
You may need to get it installed before installing gitpathlib.


In a Python 3 `virtual environment`_, do::

    python -m pip install gitpathlib

To install an editable from a Git checkout::

    python -m pip install -e.

To install without a virtual envitonment, add the ``--user`` option.

.. _virtual environment: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html


Basic Usage
-----------

A GitPath can be created from a path to a Git repository, and a commit
(or tree) in it::

    from gitpathlib import GitPath

    head = GitPath('path/to/git/repo', 'HEAD')

It can then be used as a ``Path`` would::

    path = head / 'dir' / 'file.txt'
    with path.open() as f:
        contents = f.read()

GitPath provides read-only access. Creating files, opening them in write
mode, etc. are not supported.
